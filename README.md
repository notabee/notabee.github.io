## Why this? lolz
I am **RB**. I play pixel hockey in my brain. This site is a visual representation of that process. 

It utilizes **40,000 interactive particles** driven by a custom physics engine that transitions between a humanoid form and a singularity (black hole hehe), synchronized with a generative audio synthesizer.

## Stop! You violated the law!
Okay, you didn't, but pay attention:

**You are free to:**
- Learn from the math.
- Be inspired by the audio engine.
- Star this repo.

**You are NOT free to:**
- Copy the site, change the name to "Kevin", and publish it.

> **Consequence:** If you steal this, I will find you, that's it I will find you. (p.s. I am a trained martial artist in taekwondo)

## Technical shizz
- **Three.js** for the shiny stuff.
- **Vanilla JS** because frameworks are for people who want sanity.
- **GLSL** logic (fake) for the bloom effects.
